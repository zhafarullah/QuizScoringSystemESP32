# Quiz Scoring System Using ESP32
## Introduction
This project is a simulation/miniature of a quiz scoring system controlled by an ESP32. The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of a smart and careful assessment system with a button for each team, with three teams participating so there are three buttons. Each team also has a score indicator with a maximum value of 9, where this indicator will also show the name of the team, namely "A", "B", and "C". In addition, from the jury, there are also buttons, namely a button to state whether the answer is right or wrong and a reset button to go to the next stage.
