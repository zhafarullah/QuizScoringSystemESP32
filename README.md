#Quiz Scoring System Using ESP32
## Introduction
This project is a simulation/miniature of a quiz scoring system controlled by an ESP32. The purpose of this project is to create a simulation of a smart and careful assessment system that has a button for each team, with a total of three teams participating so there are three buttons. Each team also has a score indicator with a maximum value of 9, where this indicator will also show the name of the team, namely "A", "B", and "C". In addition, from the jury's side, there are also three buttons, namely a button to state the answer is right or wrong, and a reset button to go to the next stage.
